# steamlink-debian

This repository provides a way to run Debian GNU/Linux on a Valve Steam Link device using a USB stick.

## How to use

Download an image of Debian version of your choice from the [Releases](https://github.com/djmuted/steamlink-debian/releases) page and flash it on a 2GB (or bigger) USB stick using [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) or any other USB flasher. SD cards paired with a USB SD Reader work as well.

> :warning: **Warning**: Flashing the image on the USB stick will wipe all data stored on the device!

Plug the USB stick into the Steam Link and power it on. The device will boot from the USB stick and appear on your network soon.

## Default passwords

> :warning: **Recommended**: Consider changing your passwords with `passwd` after first login.

### Default user

User: `debian`
password: `steamlink`

## First boot

For the first boot a LAN connection is required. Once the new kernel starts booting, there will be no HDMI output anymore. Connect to the Steam Link via SSH. Local IP address can be found in your router's DHCP table.

### Change hostname

This the first thing you should do after logging in, some commands might not work without a proper hostname.

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname steamlink
echo '127.0.0.1 steamlink' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

### Sync date and time

Since we don't have an RTC, you might have to do that after each reboot.

```bash
sudo ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com
```

### Resize root partition to full disk size

Resize the partition to take the entire space:

```bash
sudo parted /dev/sda resizepart 1 100%
```

Confirm with `Yes` and press enter, then resize the filesystem:

```
sudo resize2fs /dev/sda1
```

This might take a while, depending on your disk size.

## What does not work

- NAND driver
- DMA controller
- video/audio output
- suspend/resume/halt/reboot
- RTC
